 The purpose of my app is to determine the weather conditions and helps those who want to know about the weather conditions of their surroundings. the purpose of this app is to provide users with an easy accessible way to check  the weather forecast. a lot of people lately are always on their phones  so this app l created it to eliminate the need to watch tv or wait for a specific time to watch the weather forecast on the news they could simply do it on their phones. 

 HOW MY APP WORKS 
 The user will launch the app after he or she launches the app they will come across a splash screen which already has a name and student number, for them toaccess the main screen they have to click the button that’s written main screen . If they not interested in continuing with the process they can simply just click the button that’s written exit.The user will see this screen only if they previously clickedon the button that’s written "main screen". If the user clicks on day they’ll have to enter a day it can either be Monday or Tuesday or any day they wan then click on the Min option then enter the minimum number then Max option then enter the maximum number, lastly the user will have to click on the display button to see the weather conditions. If the user has inserted wrong information he or she can simply click on the button that says clear. And if they don’t want to continue with the process they can simply click on back and the it will take them back to the splash screen.
